TEXKIT LIB:

DEPENDENCIES: send2trash, libtmux (if using tmux)

*tmux is highly recommended to ensure a smoother experience*

These functions will only work if your .tex directories are
structured as such:

[dir storing main texfile]
    misc
    .
    .
    .
    main.tex (f)
    sections (d)
        1.tex
        2.tex
        .
        .
        .
        n.tex

key being ideally sub/input files should be stored in a separate
'sections' folder to keep things clean
